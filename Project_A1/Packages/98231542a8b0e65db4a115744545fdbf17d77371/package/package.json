In the Unity Dashboard, refer to ad units to surface ads in your game, set up your mediation strategies, and use reporting and analytics to track performance.\n\nSupported platforms:\n▪ Android\n▪ iOS",

    "changelog": "### Added\n- The adapter settings window will now identify adapters that are configured on the dashboard, and warn the user if it is configured and not installed or vice-versa\n- Banner support for Unity, AdColony, Admob, AppLovin and Vungle\n- Banner UI component to facilitate banner integration in Unity UI.\n- Support for Snapchat Ad Network, interstitial and rewarded Header Bidding ads. \n- Support for Mintegral Ad Network, interstitial and rewarded Header Bidding ads. \n- Added build settings option to toggle support for dynamic linking on ios.\n\n### Changed\n- Reduced the amount of logging in editor, only calls on unsupported platforms will generate warnings\n- Mock ads will only show in editor when targeting a supported platform. IE: trying to load an ad while targeting standalone will log a warning.\n- Added Async/Await API and deprecated the former API\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed bug with ad unit list search not refreshing the list in Unity 2022.\n- Fixed potential issues when attempting to build for iOS with various EDM4U versions for dynamic linking.\n- The no Game Id error log will only appear if the platform is supported.\n- Fixed issue where the switching of PSR versions would cause a compile issue that would stop the editor from importing a newer version of PSR without removing UMediation."
