 # Project_A1
## My first bigger project from my 14/15 years. 
### This project is a game created in Unity engine written in C#.
### Features of game:
- It is a game where the player move behind some body forward to collect money and jump over and avoid obstacles.
- Also it is possible to choose from different difficulty levels and different lengths of tracks including an infinite track. 
- There is also an in-game shop with the option to purchase abilities and different bodies with different characteristics. 
- Of course, there is also an inventory for selecting purchased abilities and bodies.
- I have also implemented monetization options using Unity libraries, so that the player receives a reward for seeing an ad.
### About project
- The graphic models are very basic because my skills with graphic tools are not very advanced and I wanted to make the game without using downloaded assets from the internet. Which I unfortunately didn't avoid because of the implementation of music in the game.
- The project started very enthusiastically, but with time the idea of this project was no longer interesting to me and so I decided to make only a very basic version with basic functions.
- The project is not finished, but it is in "alpha" version.
