 # Project_A1
## My first bigger project from my 14/15 years. 
### This project is a game created in Unity engine written in C#.

It is a game where the player move behind some body forward to collect money and jump over and avoid obstacles.
Also it is possible to choose from different difficulty levels and different lengths of tracks including an infinite track. 
There is also an in-game shop with the option to purchase abilities and different bodies with different characteristics. 
Of course, there is also an inventory for selecting purchased abilities and bodies.
I have also implemented monetization options using Unity libraries, so that the player receives a reward for seeing an ad.
